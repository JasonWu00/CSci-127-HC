# CSci-127-HC

Github repo for work for HC7 and HC8.

### NOTES

If two people make changes to the same file and try to push, the later person will see an error.
In which case, copy your code to a new notepad (or whatever IDE) page, pull the new work, add in your changes, and push.

Click on the green button labeled "code". If you have an SSH key, you can use SSH link. 
If you don't have one and don't want to make one, clone using HTTPS.

Use *git pull* to get the lates code and *git clone [HTTPS or SSH clone link]* to download this repo to your pc.
Use *git add [filename]* to add work to a commit, *git commit -am [descriptive sentence]* to pack the work in a commit to send out, 
and *git push* to send it out. This should be enough for basic use of github. Inform me (Jason) if anything goes wrong.
