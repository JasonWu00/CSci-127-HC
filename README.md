# CSci-127-HC

Github repo for work for HC7 and HC8.

### NOTES

If two people make changes to the same file and try to push, the later person will see an error.
In which case, copy your code to a new notepad (or whatever IDE) page, pull the new work, add in your changes, and push.

Use *git pull* to get the lates code and *git clone* to download this repo to your pc.
Use *git add* to add work to a commit, *git commit* to pack the work in a commit to send out, and *git push* to send it out.
This should be enough for basic use of github. Inform me (Jason) if anything goes wrong.
